# Development & documentation
We are in the development and debugging phase.

## Tools & scripts
This is the central guideline for how to use the development and debugging scripts in dev-run:
[README](../../spotupnp/dev-run/README.md)

Keep this README up-to-data if scripts are modified inside the dev-run folder.

## Ongoing documentation
Ongoing documentation regarding code analysis, resolved issues and anything useful that happens during development and debugging, should be stored in [RH](../../RH).
